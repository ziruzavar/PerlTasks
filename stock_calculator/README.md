This is a simple stock calculator.
You can paste a link from the site gov.capital with a given stock
and the script will tell you how the stock will do every month for 60 months.
You can enter a value that you would want to invest in stock each month and the
script will show you how much you will have by the end of the 60 months.
The static files that I am using are in a different folder.
I am using Apache24 for the web server and Perl with CGI for the actual coding.
For the web scrapper I am using  Web::Query
